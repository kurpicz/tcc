# Text Corpus Collection (tcc)
This is work in progress!
## What is it?
This project provides simple tools to obtain (popular) text corpora that are used for benchmarks and tests.

## What it is not?
We do not host any of the corpora. We just provide an easy way to get and/or compute them. Please visit the websites of the corpora for further information.

## What is contained
* [The Pizza & Chili Corpus](http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl)
